# Slim4-Skeleton

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adriansuter/Slim4-Skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adriansuter/Slim4-Skeleton)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/adriansuter/Slim4-Skeleton/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/adriansuter/Slim4-Skeleton?branch=master)

Web application skeleton that uses the [Slim4 Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/), 
[PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/) as dependency injection container, [Nyholm PSR7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) as PSR-7 implementation
and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) as template engine.

This skeleton application was built for [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).


## CAUTION

**The Slim Twig-View is still in active development and can introduce breaking changes. It is 
an alpha release. Of course you can use this skeleton, but be warned. As soon as
you update the Slim Twig-View, you might have to modify your code.**


## Installation

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim4 Framework
application.

```bash
composer create-project adriansuter/slim4-skeleton [my-app-name]
```

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application.
You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory. (Virtual host is the mandatory way to access to your project. If you try to access directly from the container folder you will encounter an error)
* Ensure `cache/` and `logs/` are web writable.

To run the application in development, you can run these commands

```bash
cd [my-app-name]
composer start
```

**That's it! Now go build something cool.**
